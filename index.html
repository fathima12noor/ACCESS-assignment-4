         <div><p>Next-gen wireless network capabilities offer the potential for revolutionary applications extending far beyond smartphones and other mobile devices. A new range of 5G use cases and applications that converge connectivity, intelligent edge, and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies will benefit everyone, from gamers to governments.
            The fifth generation of wireless technology—5G—represents the changing face of connectivity. Designed for maximum speed and capacity, 5G has the potential to vastly expand how data is moved and will enable a wide range of new applications and use cases that go far beyond the smartphone.
            
            While broad 5G rollouts are expected by 2021, engineers are already hard at work on applications and devices that will make use of the benefits of 5G. From the evolution of the IoT to revolutionary advances in how AI is used in the real world, many of tomorrow’s most exciting technological advances will depend on 5G connectivity.
            
            Harnessing the Power of IoT<br>
            
            When the term “Internet of Things” was coined in 1999, it was largely conceptual. Two decades later, everything from home thermostats to smart city sensors depend on IoT technology. Now, 5G and IoT stand ready to enable applications that would have seemed impossible just a few years ago.
            
            5G’s promise of low latency and high network capacity helps to eliminate the biggest limitations to IoT expansion. Giving devices nearly real-time ability to sense and respond, 5G and IoT are a natural pairing that will impact nearly every industry and consumer.
            
            Broadband-Like Mobile Service
            
            Upgraded mobile service is among the most noticeable of the initial impacts of the 5G network rollout. All major US wireless carriers, as well as many smaller communications service providers, intend to deploy 5G mobile networks that will deliver broadband-like services, such as high-definition streaming video without dreaded buffering. With a vastly increased network capacity, 5G is also predicted to reduce slowdowns during usage spikes—for example, sports fans can still stream during the big game.</p></div>
